```
    I have used a CreateReactApp to build the project and Tailwind CSS to style it.

    Some of the major challenges, I faced in this projects are.. 
        - Adding Time Zones
        - Handling Event Actions
        - Form Validation 
        - And Data Persistence.

    Things I could have improved/Added
        - Component Stlying
        - Writing Unit Tests
        - UI 
        - Image Storing 
        - Clearing Local Storage.
    The challenges I faced taught me new things, I didn't knew and had'nt explored.
